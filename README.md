# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  

This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using SQL.The goal is to explore,clean, and analyze sales transactions to cover insights related to revenue,customer demographics,and time-based patterns.
The dataset includes details such as transaction IDs,customers,product,categories,quantity and sales values,enabling in-depth retail performance analysis.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.


## Project Structure

**DATA EXPLORATIOIN**

Q.1 Write a sql query to view first 10 rows  
Q.2 Write a sql query to count total number of transactions  
Q.3 Write a sql query to find the number of unique customers  
Q.4 Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05  
Q.5 Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 10 in the month of Nov-2022  


**SALES AND REVENUE ANALYSIS**

Q.1 Write a SQL query to calculate total revenue  
Q.2 Write a SQL query to calculate total sales by category  
Q.3 Write a SQL query to find top 5 customers by purchase value  
Q.4 Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.  
Q.5 Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.  
Q.6 Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year  


**CUSTOMER DEMOGRAPHICS**

Q.1 Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.  
Q.2 Write a SQL query to Calculate daily sales trend  
Q.3 Write a SQL query to Calculate monthly sales trend  
Q.4 Write a SQL query to find th best selling day  


**TIME BASED ANALYSIS**

Q.1 calculate aversge sale for each month and find best selling month  
Q.2 Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.  
Q.3 Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.  
Q.4 Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales  
Q.5 Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)

## Findings

**Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty
**High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
**Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
**Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.
  

## Reports

  **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
  **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
  **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.
  

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
